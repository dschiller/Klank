# Klank

## Goals

1. Create an amazing App for free (Windows, Mac, Linux)
   - Think as a Musician instead as a Technican
2. Show that it is possible to just use pure JavaScript ( aka Vanilla JS ;) ) to create amazing Apps without getting crazy with thousands of Frameworks
3. Extract the Components and Techniques to share with other Electron Apps

Comes from 'electron-quick-start' ( https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start )

## Visions, Ideas, Enhancements, Bugs

- [ ] Add Outliner
- [ ] Dials
- [ ] Widgets
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Video Engine
- [ ] Independent Tempi per Track
- [ ] Whole UI can be matched whats needed; no systematic UI Flow; User takes what he needs like in real World
- [ ] Per Track Connection to Main Tempi or different Tracks Tempi
- [ ] Multipllier inbeetween Tempi Connections to create synced or unsynced polyrythms
- [ ] Tempi is limitless means goes from 0 BPM up to lets say 10.000 BPM
- [ ] Whole App Modifiers like LFO etc for all purposes; eg. Change Main Tempo or adding Tracks randomly with FX and a Sample Folder Pool with random Notes etc.; What comes in your Mind you should be able to do
